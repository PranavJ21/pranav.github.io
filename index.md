## 📌 Highlights

- 📚 **Quantum ML for Cancer Detection**  
  Used QSVC (Qiskit) vs classical SVMs on the WDBC dataset. Compared kernel performance on IBM Q.

- 🌧️ **Monsoon Forecasting with Arctic SIC**  
  Applied lag-aware ML models (LSTM, XGBoost) on CryoSat-2 and NSIDC SIC data to predict Indian rainfall.

- 🛰️ **Cryosphere SAR Ice Anomaly Classifier**  
  Building unsupervised models to flag Arctic anomaly events using Sentinel-1 SAR Data.

## 🎹 Music & Practice

When not researching, I spend time on the piano and guitar — learning, improvising, and relaxing.
