### üß¨ Quantum Machine Learning for Cancer Detection

[Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10895634/)

Developed and compared classical SVMs and quantum-enhanced models (QSVC with FidelityQuantumKernel) for classifying breast cancer using the WDBC dataset.

- Tools: Qiskit, IBM Q, SVM (RBF, Poly, Linear)
- Internship at C-DAC Pune, 2024
- Result: Quantum model performed comparably on a small-scale but showed promise for feature space separation.

### üßä Arctic‚ÄìIndian Monsoon Rainfall Linkage

Built an ML pipeline to explore time-lagged impact of Arctic Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) on Indian monsoon rainfall.

- Datasets: NSIDC SIC, IMD Rainfall, CryoSat-2, NOAA indices
- Approaches: LSTM, regression, causality analysis
- Goal: Forecast monsoon anomalies with improved lag-aware models

### ‚ùÑÔ∏è Ice Anomaly Classification from Satellite SAR

Currently building unsupervised ML models for anomaly detection in sea ice extent using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery and NSIDC records.

- Direction: Self-supervised learning, PCA + KMeans
- Target outcome: Flagging early ice loss or shift events in Arctic zone
