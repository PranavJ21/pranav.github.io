Hi, I'm **Pranav Joshi** — a researcher and engineer passionate about the domains of **machine learning**, **quantum computing**, and **climate science**.

I’ve worked on projects involving:
- Quantum Machine Learning for Cancer Detection
- Indian monsoon prediction using Arctic sea ice data
- Post Quantum Cryptography
- Machine Learning

I'm also a lifelong learner of piano and guitar, and balance my work with music, gym, and cycling.

This site is a collection of my academic research, personal projects, and musical journey.
